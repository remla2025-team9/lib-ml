# Sentiment Analysis Preprocessing

This Python library provides tools for text preprocessing, specifically designed for sentiment analysis tasks. It cleans and transforms text data into a format suitable for machine learning models by removing stop words, stemming, and vectorizing the text.

## Features
- **Text Cleaning**: Removes non-alphabetic characters, converts text to lowercase, removes stop words, and applies stemming.
- **TF-IDF Transformation**: Converts text data into numerical representations using the TF-IDF method.
- **Message Length Extraction**: Adds message length as an additional feature to the text data.

## Installation

Install the package via pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/remla2025-team9/lib-ml.git
```
